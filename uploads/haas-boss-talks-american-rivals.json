  "text": "# Interview with Ayao Komatsu  \r\n**March 2024 — Melbourne, Australia**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Interviewer:** Ayao, thanks for speaking with us. Let's start with the big news — for the first time in a decade, we have an 11th team on the grid. What's your reaction to Katana Racing’s debut?  \r\n**Ayao Komatsu:**  \r\nYeah, it’s exciting — and honestly, I think it’s good for the sport. More competition, more storylines, more engineering challenges. It makes everyone sharpen their approach a bit. From what we’ve seen so far, Katana’s come in with a clear identity and a serious mindset. They’re not here just for show.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Interviewer:** As someone who rose through the engineering ranks and now leads an established team, what stands out to you about how Katana is structured?  \r\n**Ayao:**  \r\nWell, first off, I have a lot of respect for Ken Tanaka. He’s a guy who understands both the sporting side and the technical side — not many team principals have raced in F1 and also worked in the trenches of engineering. You can tell there’s a sharp philosophy behind how they’re building the team — not just performance-focused, but culturally aligned, which is often overlooked.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Interviewer:** You and Ken are now two Japanese-born leaders in Formula 1. That’s a first for the sport. What does that mean to you personally?  \r\n**Ayao:**  \r\nIt’s meaningful. I never really thought about it that way until people started pointing it out, but yes — I think it shows how the sport is evolving. It’s not just drivers who can represent nations and cultures, but also the people behind the scenes. I’m proud of my background, and I’m sure Ken is too. I think it sets a strong example for young engineers and fans in Japan who might not see this kind of leadership often in global sport.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Interviewer:** From a competitive standpoint — how much of a threat do you think Katana could be, especially to teams like Haas?  \r\n**Ayao:**  \r\nLook, you never underestimate anyone in this game. Especially a new team with proper funding, experienced drivers, and a strong engine partner like Renault. They’re going to have growing pains, of course — we all did — but they’ve made some smart hires and their car looks tidy. I think they’ll be in the fight with the midfield sooner than people expect.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Interviewer:** Their lineup — Daniel Ricciardo and Ryo Hirakawa — is an interesting mix. Thoughts?  \r\n**Ayao:**  \r\nDaniel is a known quantity — fast, experienced, and brings great feedback. He’s also very good at lifting team morale, which is crucial in a new operation. As for Ryo, I know him from his Super Formula days — technically very sharp, and mentally very strong. Don’t be surprised if he starts matching Daniel’s pace by mid-season. He’s not just there to learn — he’s there to compete.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Interviewer:** From a fan perspective, how do you think Katana Racing changes the energy around F1?  \r\n**Ayao:**  \r\nIt's another bridge between East and West, which I love. Their branding is clean, modern — you can see the influence of Japanese minimalism and American confidence. And with their base in Austin and a Japanese driver in the car, they're tapping into two huge fanbases. That’s good for all of us — it raises the profile of the sport, especially in regions where it’s still growing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Interviewer:** Final question — any advice you’d give Ken Tanaka as a first-year team boss?  \r\n**Ayao:** *(laughs)*  \r\nStay patient. The F1 calendar is relentless. There will be weekends where nothing goes to plan — the key is to not overreact. Focus on steady progress. And trust your people — that’s something I’ve learned the hard way. But knowing Ken, he’s probably already got that figured out.\r\n",
