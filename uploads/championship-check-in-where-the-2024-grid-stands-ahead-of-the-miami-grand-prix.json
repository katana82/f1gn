With five races in the books and a season that’s anything but predictable, we break down how the grid is shaping up ahead of the sixth round of the season.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🏆 Drivers' Championship Standings – After China\r\n\r\n| Position | Driver                 | Team            | Points |\r\n|----------|------------------------|------------------|--------|\r\n| 1        | Max Verstappen         | Red Bull         | 115    |\r\n| 2        | Charles Leclerc        | Ferrari          | 109    |\r\n| 3        | Carlos Sainz           | Ferrari          | 83     |\r\n| 4        | Lando Norris           | McLaren          | 63     |\r\n| 5        | Sergio Pérez           | Red Bull         | 51     |\r\n| 6        | Oscar Piastri          | McLaren          | 50     |\r\n| 7        | Lewis Hamilton         | Mercedes         | 32     |\r\n| 8        | George Russell         | Mercedes         | 21     |\r\n| 9        | Fernando Alonso        | Aston Martin     | 11     |\r\n| 10       | Yuki Tsunoda           | RB               | 9      |\r\n| 11       | Lance Stroll           | Aston Martin     | 2      |\r\n| 12–22    | Multiple drivers       | Various Teams    | 0      |\r\n\r\n> **Note:** Ricciardo, Hirakawa, Albon, Ocon, Gasly, and others remain point-less heading into Round 6.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ⚔️ The Battle at the Top: Verstappen vs. Ferrari\r\n\r\n**Max Verstappen** continues to lead the championship after a dominant win in China, but Ferrari is keeping the pressure on. **Charles Leclerc** trails by just **6 points**, and **Carlos Sainz**, thanks to consistent podiums, remains within striking distance. The early-season reliability and pace from Ferrari have turned this into the tightest title race since 2021.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 💡 Midfield Movers & Surprises\r\n\r\n- **Lando Norris** and **Oscar Piastri** are proving McLaren's resurgence is real — both drivers are scoring consistently, with Norris already chalking up multiple top-5 finishes.\r\n- **Mercedes** is still hunting for a breakthrough. While **Hamilton** sits P7 and **Russell** P8, the Silver Arrows haven’t yet found a way to fight for podiums.\r\n- **Fernando Alonso** and **Yuki Tsunoda** round out the top 10, each punching above the weight of their respective machinery.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ❌ Zero Club: Trouble at the Back\r\n\r\nA total of **11 drivers** are still without a point heading into Miami — including both **Katana Racing** drivers:\r\n\r\n- **Daniel Ricciardo**: Best result is P12 in Australia  \r\n- **Ryo Hirakawa**: Two DNFs and three finishes outside the top 20  \r\n\r\nOther scoreless drivers include **Albon**, **Hülkenberg**, **Iwasa**, **Ocon**, **Magnussen**, **Gasly**, **Bottas**, **Sargeant**, and **Zhou**.\r\n\r\nDespite Ricciardo’s experience and flashes of solid pace, Katana Racing remains scoreless in its debut campaign — though Miami presents a golden opportunity on U.S. soil.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🔮 What to Watch in Miami\r\n\r\n- Can **Ferrari** finally knock **Verstappen** off the top of the standings?\r\n- Will **Ricciardo or Hirakawa** claim Katana’s first points on home turf?\r\n- Can **McLaren** keep their momentum going — or will **Mercedes** begin to bite back?\r\n- And with rumors swirling around **Pierre Gasly's 2025 future**, could Miami's paddock be buzzing with more than just heat and horsepower?\r\n\r\nOne thing’s for sure — the 2024 title race is wide open, and Miami could be where the next chapter is written.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Stay with **F1GN** for live coverage, paddock buzz, and post-race reaction all Grand Prix weekend.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n",
