  "text": "When the 2024 Formula 1 season lights up, **Katana Racing** will enter the grid as the sport’s long-anticipated 11th team — a sharp new challenger blending American ambition, Japanese precision, and global motorsport expertise. Headquartered in **Austin, Texas**, Katana Racing is the latest entry in Formula 1’s ongoing expansion, created with the goal of shaking up the midfield and pushing the sport deeper into U.S. and Asian markets.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Blade Behind the Badge\r\n\r\nWhile the team may be new, the man at the helm is not. **Ken Tanaka**, a former F1 driver from the early 2000s, has been named **Team Principal** of Katana Racing. Tanaka, born and raised in **Seattle, Washington**, is well-respected in the paddock for his intelligence, calm leadership, and deep racing pedigree.\r\n\r\nThough his driving career was cut short by injury, he transitioned into engineering and later team strategy roles across various racing series — eventually becoming a highly sought-after figure behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nNow, he returns to Formula 1 not behind the wheel, but at the head of the pit wall, bringing a racer’s mindset and a visionary’s discipline. Tanaka was approached by the new ownership group — a consortium of tech and motorsport investors — specifically to build a **performance-first culture** from day one.\r\n\r\n> The team name, **Katana**, was chosen as a tribute to Japanese craftsmanship and the sharpness of vision Tanaka embodies. Sleek, precise, and uncompromising — Katana Racing aims to reflect those values both in design and execution.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Austin Roots, Global Intent\r\n\r\nOperating out of a high-tech facility in **Austin**, just steps away from the **Circuit of the Americas**, Katana Racing is deeply connected to the American motorsport revival. With a **wind tunnel partnership in Japan** and **advanced simulation centers in the U.S.**, the team positions itself as a **transpacific powerhouse**, built for agility and innovation.\r\n\r\nKatana will run **Renault power units** in its debut season — a strategic decision made to ensure reliability and flexibility while the team focuses on mastering chassis and aero development. The Renault engine gives Katana a stable platform as they find their footing in F1’s fiercely competitive landscape.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Driver Lineup: The Samurai and the Showman\r\n\r\nKatana Racing’s 2024 lineup turns heads — and not just for the contrast in styles.\r\n\r\n- **Daniel Ricciardo**  \r\n  The fan-favorite Aussie and proven race winner leads the charge. After a rocky few seasons, Ricciardo saw Katana as a clean slate — a new project where his experience and energy could make a real impact. He brings **charisma, racecraft, and leadership** to a young team hungry to prove itself.\r\n\r\n- **Ryo Hirakawa**  \r\n  Japan’s rising motorsport star, fresh off success in **World Endurance** and **Super Formula**. Calm, technically sharp, and fiercely consistent, Hirakawa is **Tanaka’s hand-picked driver** — a fellow countryman and a reflection of the team’s fusion of cultures.\r\n\r\nTheir partnership also coincides with **Ayumu Iwasa’s** promotion to AlphaTauri, setting up a fascinating parallel narrative as Japan’s top drivers take center stage in 2024.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Forging the Future\r\n\r\nKatana Racing isn’t expected to win right out of the gate — and they’re not pretending otherwise. But they are **here to fight**. With a lean structure, a driven team principal, and a car that’s been obsessively developed in the wind tunnel and simulator, Katana’s aim is simple:\r\n\r\n- Learn fast  \r\n- Strike hard  \r\n\r\n**Points** are the target. **Q2 appearances** are the goal. **Consistency** is the mantra.\r\n\r\nFor **Ken Tanaka**, it's more than a comeback — it's a **legacy in the making**.",
